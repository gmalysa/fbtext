Two programs to help with systems that use draw2fb.

## fbtext
This is just a command line frontend to draw2fb, it lets you set the configuration options and
then updates the framebuffer

## dumpfb
This is used to dump the framebuffer contents to the command line to help debug weird situations
where the physical display doesn't match what you expect on the framebuffer
